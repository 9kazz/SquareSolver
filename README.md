# Square Solver 🔥

## Program will be useful for you 🤓
```
If you:  

1) haven't graduated primary school 👶

2) are too stupid to solve a quadratic equation but clever enough to copy my program from the repository to your coding environment and run it 🤤

3) are unbelievably lazy to solve a quadratic equation 🥱
```

## How to build 🚀
```
Just print "make" in console)
```
## Files included in program 📁
```
1) main.cpp

2) math_ops.cpp & math_ops.h are files with basic math functions

3) utest_file.cpp & utest_file.h are files with all functions necessary for testing my program

4) utils.cpp & utils.h are files with all supporting secondary functions such as input and output functions
```

## How to use 📖
```
To run this program you must use the command line (CL) in the terminal. After the name of the file containing your compiled program you should enter one of the CL flags:

1) "-c" to solve your equation. After "-c" you should enter the coefficients of your equation (like this: "-c 1 2 1")

2) "-t" and then "-f name_of_your_testing_file" to run unit-testing of the program
NOTE: you must enter CL flags as shown in the example: "-c 1 2 1" or "-t -f file_name"

My project "Square_Solver" will be useful for you if you:
  1) hasn't graduated primary-school
  2) too stupid to solve quadratic equation but clever enough to remove my program from reposytory to your coding environment and run it
  3) unbelievably lazy to solve quadratic equition

My program includes 7 files:
  1) main.cpp
  2) math_ops.cpp & math_ops.h are files with basic math funcions
  3) utest_file.cpp & utest_file.h are files with all functions which necessery to testing my program
  4) utils.cpp & utils.h are files with all supporting secondary functions such as input and output functions

How to use:
  To run this program you must use the command line (CL) in the terminal. After name of the file where you compiled progrem you should print one of the CL flags:
    1) "-c" to solve your equation. After "-c" you should print coefficients of your equation (like this: "-c 1 2 1"
    2) "-t" and then "-f *name of your testing file*" to run unit-testing of the program
NOTE: you must print CL flags according the example: "-c 1 2 1" or "-t -f *file name*"
